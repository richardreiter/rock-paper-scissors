# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game

[Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](https://richardreiter.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/) is a website hosting a web based game invented by [Sam Kass & Karen Bryla](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html). This game was popularised by the American TV sitcom [The Big Bang Theory](https://youtu.be/x5Q6-wMx-K8), as an improvement of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game.
The Lizard and Spock addition is meant to give the game a twist and make it more fun/exciting.

The player will test their luck against the computer, making a choice of their weapon in each round - Try and beat the computer, first to reach 5 points wins!
